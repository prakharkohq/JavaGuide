## Description

### Introduction

* ** For Java beginners: ** This document tends to give you a more detailed learning path, giving you a first look at the overall knowledge of Java. In addition, some articles in this article
It is also a good practice for you to learn and review Java knowledge;
* ** For non-Java beginners: ** This document is more suitable for reviewing knowledge, preparing for an interview, and understanding the interview should focus on those issues. To figure this out: Know in advance that interviews are common, not to deal with interviews, but to give you more targeted learning.

### About reprinting

If you need to reprint some of the articles in this warehouse to your own blog, remember to indicate the original address.

### How to contribute to this open source document

1. Most of the notes are hand-knocked, so it is inevitable that there will be a clerical error. You can help me find the wrong word.
2. A lot of knowledge points may not be covered, so you can supplement other knowledge points.
3. Existing knowledge points are inevitably imperfect or wrong, so you can modify/supplement existing knowledge points.

### Why do you want to do this open source document?

The initial idea stems from a rather confusing learning experience in my own individual. The main purpose is to help some of the friends who are having problems learning Java or interviewing through this open source platform.

### Post

Due to my limited personal abilities, I may not have covered a lot of knowledge points, so you can supplement other knowledge points. You can also self-recommend your own articles. For a good article, you can not only successfully display it in this warehouse, but also get any books worth about 50 yuan from the author to reward (of course you can also directly discount 50 yuan).
